# Eliza Task

## Brief Introduction

The Eliza Task is inspired by one of the first natural language processing (NLP) programs, ELIZA, developed by Joseph Weizenbaum at MIT in the 1960s. ELIZA uses pattern matching and substitution to simulate human-like conversations. The most famous script, "DOCTOR," emulates a Rogerian psychotherapist. This task challenges you to build a web-based version of ELIZA that can interact with users by simulating a conversation.

## Requirements

1. **Fork the Repository:**  
   Fork the ELIZA task repository to your GitHub account:  
   [https://github.com/ReyadGH/ELIZA](https://github.com/ReyadGH/ELIZA)

2. **Create the Following Pages:**
   - **Main Page (🤖_ELIZA):**  
     This page should serve as the entry point to your project and give a brief overview of ELIZA.
   - **The Chat Page:**  
     Here, users will be able to interact with ELIZA. The page should simulate a conversation using pattern matching and substitutions.
   - **Team Page:**  
     Provide information about the team behind the project. This could include your name, role, and a brief description of the project.

3. **Simulate Human-Like Interaction:**  
   Your ELIZA chatbot should be able to simulate a conversation based on simple scripts, like the "DOCTOR" script. The bot should react appropriately to the user's inputs.

4. **Pull Request:**  
   Once you’re done, create a pull request with your changes.
